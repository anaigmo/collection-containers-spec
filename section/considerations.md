## Considerations {#considerations}

### Identifying collections and containers

An `rr:template` or `rr:column` may be provided for the generation of blank node IDs (`rr:BlankNode`) or IRIs (`rr:IRI`). In some cases, there are challenges when identifiers are generated. The challenge generating identifiers for collections and containers: one needs to be careful when a gather map uses multi-valued references in the template or generates multiple collections and containers:

* In the former, the gather map must return “deep” copies of collections. This is to avoid only generating a new IRI or blank node identifier for the first cons-pair and hence having multiple lists sharing the same sublist.
* In the latter, we may end up with multiple lists and containers sharing the same blank node identifier or IRI, which may produce valid RDF, but nonsensical containers and collections.

If no `rr:template` or `rr:column` is provided for generating blank node IDs (`rr:BlankNode`) or IRIs (`rr:IRI`), then each iteration generates a new blank node identifier for the collection or container.

### Iterations and gather maps yielding the same identifier

If term maps were to generate the same identifier for collections and containers, the result might result in valid RDF but ill-formed RDF collections and containers. We identify two cases:

*  A gather map yields the same identifier for two iterations. In that case, the nature of the resource (collection or container) remains the same, and values are appended.

* Two gather maps yield the same identifier for two iterations. In that case, the nature of the resources generated by these gather maps may be different, resulting in resources of two different types (e.g., rdf:List and rdf:Bag). An RML processor will produce those as this is valid RDF, though the respective lists and containers are not well-formed.

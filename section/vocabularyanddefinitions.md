## Vocabulary and definitions {#vocabulary}

This section introduces the classes, properties, and constants of the RML Containers and Collections specification.

### Classes

#### `rml:GatherMap`
Gather maps are term maps that use [`rml:gather`](#rml-gather) and [`rml:gatherAs`](#rml-gatheras) to generate collections and containers from a list of term maps. 

If a gather map has no template or term type directive, at each iteration it is assumed to be generating a blank node that is the head of the collection or container.

* A `rml:GatherMap` MUST have exactly one [`rml:gather`](#rml-gather) property.
* A `rml:GatherMap` MUST have exactly one [`rml:gatherAs`](#rml-gatheras) property.

### Properties

#### `rml:gather`

The `rml:gather` informs the RML processor where the terms of a collection or container come from. This property relates a gather map with a non-empty list of term maps. 
That list of term maps may contain other gather maps, which means that this will generate nested containers and collections. One is not limited to nesting only containers or collections, both containers and collections can be mixed.

* The domain of `rml:gather` is [`rml:GatherMap`](#rml-gathermap).
* The range of `rml:gather` is a non-empty list of `rr:TermMap` instances. This list may include instances of [`rml:GatherMap`](#rml-gathermap). We thus support the nesting of collections and containers.

#### `rml:strategy`
Declaring an `rml:strategy` on a gather map informs the processor how to create collections and containers when faced with multi-valued term maps. 
This specification defines both `rml:Append` and `rml:CartesianProduct` as instances of `rml:Strategy`. 

In the `rml:Append` strategy, terms generated by each term map of the list are simply appended to the collection (respectively container) being constructed. Thus, only one collection (respectively container) is generated.

Conversely, in the `rml:CartesianProduct` strategy, the gather map generates collections (respectively containers) each containing one term generated by each term map of the list. In other words, it carries out a cartesian product between the terms generated by each term map, thus constructing as many collections (respectively containers) as the product of the number of terms from each term map. For example, if a collection contains two term maps generating respectively 2 and 3 terms, the gather map will generate 6 collections of 2 terms each.

A gather map does not need to specify a strategy, the default strategy is `rml:Append`.

#### `rml:gatherAs`

The property `rml:gatherAs` relates a gather map with the desired result type: a type of container or collections.

* The domain of `rml:gatherAs` is [`rml:GatherMap`](#rml-gathermap).
* The range of `rml:gatherAs` is one of the following: `rdf:Seq`, `rdf:Bag`, `rdf:Alt`, `rdf:List`.

#### `rml:allowEmptyListAndContainer`
The range of `rml:allowEmptyListAndContainer` is a `xsd:boolean` and is by default false. This predicate is to be used alongside [`rml:gather`](#rml-gather) and [`rml:gatherAs`](#rml-gatheras). When true and an [`rml:gather`](#rml-gather) does not yield any element, then the gather map will generate `rdf:nil` for an RDF collection, or a resource with no members for an RDF container.

* The domain of `rml:allowEmptyListAndContainer` is [`rml:GatherMap`](#rml-gathermap).
* The range of `rml:allowEmptyListAndContainer` is `xsd:boolean`.
